Solution 1 is a unified, fail‑safe control system for railway level crossings that integrates train approach monitoring with obstruction detection. It activates flashing lights and lowers boom gates when a train is within 100 metres, keeping them down until the last carriage has passed and the crossing is clear. If an obstruction is detected, a 10‑second delay precedes gate closure and light activation, followed by a 20‑second clearance period after the obstruction is gone. Train detection takes priority over obstruction clearance, and in any sensor fault the system defaults to gates lowered and lights flashing, ensuring maximum safety for both rail and road users.
