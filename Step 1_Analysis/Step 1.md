1a)  Design a logic-based system that lowers the gates at a railway crossing if a train is approaching or if a vehicle is still on the tracks and raises them when it is safe.
1b) Inputs: train detector, vehicle on tracks sensor. Outputs: Lower gate motor, Raise gate motor, warning lights.
1c) If the climate that the gate is constructed in is cold then the components may need to be maintained to prevent icing over and therefore not working. Similarly, if the climate is hot, they need to be cooled to prevent overheating and not working. These systems may be taken from other suppliers; however, a contract should be defined ahead of time to limit extra rush job fees to the company in charge of suppling the boom gates.  If the parts are not sourced from a reliable producer, they may not work as intended due to quality control issues, therefore a vetting process of all possible suppliers for quality products may be useful. If the gate is constructed where the nearby population havenâ€™t seen a gate before, they may need to be informed as to how the gate works, whether it be by an announcement or by easy-to-understand signs near the crossing. Additionally, sufficient warning/informational signs should be placed in and around the crossing to notify the public and train driver of the crossing and its potential dangers.
