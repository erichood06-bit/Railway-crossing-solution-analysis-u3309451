3&4) Solution 1 is relatively simple in contrast to the researched solution as it doesn’t include an LCD screen, nor “waiting time” calculations therefore reducing the number of components in the solution that could encounter failures. Additionally, the distance between the crossing and sensors can be adjusted quite easily, and the number of lights can be increased as well, allowing for easy optimisation if needed in the future. Also, reducing the potentially distracting LCD screen could help keep drivers focus on the road and potentially limit the number of vehicles that attempt to drive past the gates due to long perceived waiting times. The addition of a circuit to detect if a vehicle is on the tracks for too long allows for emergency situations to be controlled quite effectively as it is integrated into the solution and the responders will have options to deal with it effectively. Finally, the relatively simple nature of the solution, being the limiting of components that could have faults or unintended consequences, combined with good quality control procedures when implementing the solution, both before and during the construction, allow for a reliable end product.
